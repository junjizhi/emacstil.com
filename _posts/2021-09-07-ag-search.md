Use `counsel-projectile-ag`.

I like to bind it a common shortcut, like `Super` + `f` (or `s-f`), so that I can pass the `universal argument` with `C-u` to filter results.

**Example: To search in CoffeeScript and Javascript files only**:

1.  Press `C-u s-f`
2.  Type `--coffee --js` and press enter
3.  Type search string and press enter

`Ag` is one of the things that, if you understand the command line options, it helps a lot. It has built-in multiple groups of file types. Run the command to find out: `ag --list-file-types`.

You can also **filter files with pattern**: `-G erb`
