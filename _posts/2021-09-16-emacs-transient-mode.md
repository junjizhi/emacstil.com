I&rsquo;ve been using Magit for a long time and haven&rsquo;t thought about 

Recently I bumped into this concept of `Emacs transient` and realized it is talking about `Magit` command popup window. I&rsquo;ve using Magit nearly everyday and this UI is so useful!

After researching `transient` a little bit, I found this [video](https://youtu.be/w3krYEeqnyk) from the [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/f3o0v8/anyone_have_good_examples_for_transient/).

Adrien made an excellent presentation explaining how to build transient, and I don&rsquo;t feel the need to go into details here.

A few things that widen my eyesight:

-   How easy it is to make a major mode
-   How to call shell commands, i.e., with `(shell-command-to-string)`
-   How easy it is to make a transient command

Seeing the Emacs tricks step by step saves lots of my time of reading docs. Thanks Adrien!
