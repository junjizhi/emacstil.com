[Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) comes with the [emacs-everywhere](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/modules/app/everywhere/README.org) support.

With it, you can edit text anywhere with Emacs.

The bash script:

```bash
/path/to/emacsclient --eval "(emacs-everywhere)"
```

Then I assign the hotkey `âŒ˜ + F9` to the service in Keyboard settings:
