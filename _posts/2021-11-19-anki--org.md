This post is about sync how to sync Org and Anki notes manually.

*Background*: In an effort to consolidate all my notes into \*.org files, I need to
deal with the old Anki decks.

Luckily Anki supports exporting into plaintext files.

If you want to import the same file, you need [an
add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1672832404) to generate the Node
ID field for each note.

Make sure Node ID field is added in the deck setup:

Sample exported txt file:

> 9162f8c6-4942-11ec-8423-acde48001122 front 1 updated back 1 updated
> 98699bac-4942-11ec-8423-acde48001122 front 2 updated back 2 updated

With this plaintext file, you can use whatever you are comfortable to
convert them into your org format.

For example, if you are using [Org-Roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam), the first note can be converted
to:

``` org
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9162f8c6-4942-11ec-8423-acde48001122
:END:
#+title: front 1 updated
* Front
front 1 updated
* Back
back 1 updated
```

After you are done editing on org, it is a matter of converting them
back to the plaintext files and importing them into Anki again:

In this way, you can manually sync Org and Anki notes.
