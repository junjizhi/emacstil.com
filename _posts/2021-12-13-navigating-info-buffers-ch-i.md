I found the `info` mode hard to use so I made a personal cheat sheet.

_Background_: Emacs has built-in TeXinfo that is helpful to learn about certain
topics, like `org-mode`. To invoke the info manual, you can
do `M-x info`, of use the keybinding: `C-h i`.

There is good information recorded in `info` buffers. But the default key binding is
different from our everyday programs.

Below are the navigation keys I need to consult from time to time:

- `m` -\> jump to a link
- `l` or `r` -\> go backward or forward in history
- `u` -\> go up one level
- `[` or `]`: go to previous or next node

I will add them to a cheat sheet until they become muscle memory.
