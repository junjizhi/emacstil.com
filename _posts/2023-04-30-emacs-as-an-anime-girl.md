Another fun experiment with Artificial Intelligence Global Company
(AIGC)! I feed the following prompt to Dall-E and Midjourney:

> Emacs as an anime girl

[Dall-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-api-now-available-in-public-beta)
generation:

[MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/app/) generation:

![midjourney emacs as an anime girl](https://i.imgur.com/EhPbLWz.jpg)

We can see that AI is trying blend the purple from the Emacs logo with
the anime style.

Personally I like MidJourney one better as it has more details and
closer to what we usually perceive anime.

What do you think? Feel free to drop me a note!
