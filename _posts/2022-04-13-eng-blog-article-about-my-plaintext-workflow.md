Today I published an [article](https://medium.com/p/ac96492eff2e) in
Gusto Engineering Blog. It is about how I manage my working memory with
a single plaintext file: `wm.txt`. And later the workflow evolved into a
`wm.org` file and leverage all the power of org-mode!

Feel free to check out [the article](https://medium.com/p/ac96492eff2e)!
