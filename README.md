# Introduction 

Emacstil.com: A site that shares my tips and tricks I learned about Emacs.

The site is generated with jekyll, a static site generator.

# Theme

It was adapted from [Forever Jekyll - A simple, elegant & full featured Jekyll theme](https://forever-jekyll.github.io).

I tweaked the google analytics and added some SEO improvements.

There are also some styling tweaks, e.g., make the gray background so that the text content stand out and looks focused.
